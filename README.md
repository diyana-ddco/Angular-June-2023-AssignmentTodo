# Angular App AssignmentTodo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## About

This Angular app was developed as part of an SoftUni Angular course assessment. The objective was to utilize elements covered in the course so far, such as Components, @Input and @Output decorators, OnChanges lifecycle hook, two-way data binding, while avoiding more advanced concepts like routes, services, and Reactive Forms.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
